# Dreams of billion girls - lab 1 - variant 6

It is the laboratory work 1 of computational process organization.
We need to realize the dictionary based on binary-tree.

## Project structure

- `mutable.py` -- implementation of `BinaryNode` class and `Dict` class with some necessary features.

- `mutable_test.py` -- unit and tests for `Dict`.

- `BinaryTree.py` -- The data structure definition of binary tree and some operations on binary tree.

## Features

- PBT: PBT tests will be updated as soon as we can.
- unit:`test_insert`,`test_size`,`test_to_list`,`test_find`,`test_from_list`,`test_delete`
- unit: `test_filter_func_value`,`test_map_func`,`test_reduce_func`
- unit: `test_iter`,`test_mempty`,`test_mconcat`

## Contribution

- Ye Shuzhan (765247983@qq.com) -- mutable version.

## Changelog

- 30.04.2022 - 1
  - Since it was found that some unsolvable problems occurred in the writing process of the binary balanced tree,
  the previous code was overturned, a simple binary tree was chosen as the new data structure, and the code was rewritten.
- 15.04.2022 - 0
  - Select a binary balanced tree as the data structure to implement the program named AVTree, complete part of the unit test
