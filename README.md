# Dreams of billion girls - lab 1 - variant 6

It is the laboratory work 1 of computational process organization.
We need to realize the dictionary based on binary-tree.

## Project structure

- `mutable.py` -- implementation of `BinaryNode` class and `Dict`
- class with some necessary features.

- `mutable_test.py` -- unit and tests for `Dict`.

- `BinaryTree.py` -- The data structure definition of binary tree
- and some operations on binary tree.

## Features

- PBT:`test_from_list_to_list_equality`,`test_python_len_and_list_size_equlity`
- PBT:`test_monoid_identity`,`test_monoid_associativity`
- unit:`test_insert`,`test_size`,`test_to_list`,`test_find`,`test_from_list`,`test_delete`
- unit: `test_filter_func_value`,`test_map_func`,`test_reduce_func`
- unit: `test_iter`,`test_mempty`,`test_mconcat`

## Contribution

- Ye Shuzhan (765247983@qq.com) -- mutable version.
- Wang Zhixiong (1006351013@qq.com) -- mutable version.

## Changelog

- 04.05.2022 - 3
  - This time, the PBT test in the homework has been added.
- 04.05.2022 - 2
  - This time, some codes have been updated,
  - and the code has been fixed after re-understanding the characteristics of monoid.
- 30.04.2022 - 1
  - Since it was found that some unsolvable problems occurred
  - in the writing process of the binary balanced tree,
  - the previous code was overturned,
  - a simple binary tree was chosen as the new data structure, and the code was rewritten.
- 15.04.2022 - 0
  - Select a binary balanced tree as the data structure to
  - implement the program named AVTree,
  - complete part of the unit test
